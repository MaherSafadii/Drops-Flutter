To show a Drop all you have to do it the following:

```dart

this displays a bare minimum Drop, to get the most, you can customize them like this:

```dart
Drops.show(
    context,
    title: 'Title',
    subtitle: 'subtitle',
    icon: CupertinoIcons.smiley_fill,
    isDestructive: false,
    highContrastText: true,
    position: DropPosition.top,
    shape: DropShape.pill,
 );
```

Heres the full list of parameters that you can use to adjust the Drop to match your needs:

```dart
    required String title
    Duration duration
    Duration? transitionDuration
    TextStyle? textStyle
    Curve curve = Curves.easeOutExpo
